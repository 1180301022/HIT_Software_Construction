A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go. Make haste in doing good, restrain your mind from evil. Whosoever is slow in doing well, his mind delights in evil? As from a heap of flowers many a garland is made even so many good deeds should be done by one born a mortal. Be tolerant among the intolerant, gentle among the violent, and free from greed among the greedy. As a beautiful flower that is full of hue but lacks fragrance, even so fruitless is the well-spoken word of one who does not practice it.
